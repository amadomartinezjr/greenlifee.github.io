      <h1>Donate</h1>
      <h3>Worn out clothes can be resuable. Follow these easy steps.</h3>
      <div id="bannerImage"><img src="img/donatebanner.png" alt="clover"/></div>
		
      <h1>1. Divide and Conquer</h1>
      <p>Sort your stuff into three piles: great condition, good condition and poor condition. Great-condition clothing looks new, has retained its shape perfectly, and bears no signs of wear and tear. Usable-condition clothing may be a little bit faded or worn but still in wearable condition with no stains or holes. Poor-condition clothing is stained, threadbare or has holes in it. </p>
		
      <h1>2. Clothing Swaps and Consignment Stores</h1>
		
      <p>Great-condition clothing and accessories are excellent candidates for clothing swaps or consignment stores. To host a clothing swap, invite a handful of good friends who wear approximately the same size to bring their closet surplus, and you can exchange clothes among you. Alternately, bring your items to a consignment store in your area. They’ll sell them for you and give you a portion of the proceeds.</p>
		
      <h1>3. Thrift Stores &amp; Charity Donations</h1>
		
      <p>Good-condition clothing can be donated to a thrift store like Value Village, Goodwill or Salvation Army. There, the clothing is sorted, priced and placed on the sales floor for secondhand shoppers to find. Oftentimes thrift stores use the proceeds from the sale of these items to support charity initiatives. </p>
	  <h1>4. Clothing Recycling</h1>
		<p>For those stained, torn or otherwise unwearable textiles, clothing recycling is the answer. Find a drop-off spot near you using our Recycling Locator.Some companies like Patagonia accept their own clothing items back for recycling, while fashion retailers like H&M and American Eagle Outfitters offer in-store clothing recycling bins to collect textiles and accessories of any brand, so recycling your clothing is now as easy as a trip to the mall.</p>
		<h1>Donate Your Used Car </h1>
		<p>There are several organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, Make-a-Wish, and more that accept cars as donations. Even when cars aren’t running quite as well as they used to, many non-profit organizations will take the vehicles, and have them deconstructed for parts.  If the car is still usable, then a less-fortunate family would get much use out of it, without it ending up as scraps in the local trash heap. Cars can provide a decent charitable deduction that can provide you with some tax-relief!</p>
		<h1> Appliances & Furniture</h1>
		<p>Organizations such as Good Will are great for dropping off worn clothes, appliances, furniture, toys, and much more. Many people don’t immediately consider clothing donation eco-friendly. However, the number of resources it takes to create new clothing, ship them to stores, and the paper waste during the sales process is considerable. By donating your used clothing, you are allowing someone else to make good use of it. It keeps more clothing and other items out of landfills. On the plus side, it gives you the potential to receive tax-credit for the fair market value of your donation, making it a win-win!</p>

		  <h2>Fun Fact.</h2>
		  <p>Clothes can take up to 40 years to decompose. Once we throw out our clothes, we accept the fact that we’ll never see them again. However, just because our discarded clothes are no longer in our lives, it doesn’t mean they’ve disappeared. While some materials take longer to decompose than others, all have harmful effects for the environment. In addition to releasing gases like methane, most fabrics are made with dyes and chemicals that can contaminate the soil and water in the ground.</p>
