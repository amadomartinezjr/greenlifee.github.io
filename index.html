      <p>The meaning of the word “green” has long outgrown the color. It’s now frequently used in a colloquial speech to apply to almost everything related to benefiting the environment, from the movement to architecture and fashion. </p>
		
	  <p>Today is World Environment Day - a day when our focus turns to the impact we’re having on the environment and how we can clean up the planet.As awareness increases, people are becoming more willing than ever before to make changes to their lifestyle but, more often than not, the effort these changes require can make living a more eco-friendly life seem near-on impossible. As well if you are tired of living a wasteful lifestyle and are resolved to live a more eco-friendly lifestyle this new year, you might feel a little overwhelmed about all of the big changes in your life. Starting something new can be stressful when you are unsure where to begin. Rest assured, you have already completed the most difficult step – deciding to make a change. Focus on smaller changes you can make easily before you tackle the more difficult steps of your eco-friendly resolution.</p>
	  <p>Eco-friendly style isn’t confined to one specific look. Sustainable goods and energy-conscious designs can be incorporated into many different decorating styles. If you’re on the fence about eco-friendly changes, ask yourself these questions:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Are you inspired to leave the earth better than you found it? </li>
		  <li>Do you want to create a healthier home for yourself and your family?</li>
		  <li>Do you think harmony with nature is important?</li>
		  <li>Are you a fiend for natural light?</li>
		  <li>Do you feel satisfaction in knowing exactly what materials and chemicals are in your home?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>If you answered yes to these questions, then you may want to consider incorporating more eco-friendly designs into your lifestyle.</p>
	  <p> Living a GreenLife style can be easier than you thought.&nbsp;If your day-to-day actions are more environmentally friendly you not only help the environment, but you can benefit financially, physically and mentally as well. </p>
